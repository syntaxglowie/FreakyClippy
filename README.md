## Clippy: your desktop buddy!
You missed clippy so badly, right? Well, now you can have him on your desktop and provide you with motivational quotes and uplifting messages. It's 100% free, too!

## Usage
Because I am too lazy to make an installer, you should compile the code and add the files marked "files for .exe directory" to the directory of the .exe file. Then you can run your Clippy instance, or hell, even add it to Autostart.
