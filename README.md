## Clippy: your desktop buddy!
You missed clippy so badly, right? Well, now you can have him on your desktop and provide you with motivational quotes and uplifting messages. It's 100% free, too!
By default it talks every 1.5 to 10 minutes. You can change that by right clicking on Clippy and choosing "Settings".

## Usage
You can download the installer from the latest release [here](https://github.com/syntaxglowie/FreakyClippy/releases/tag/stable), or... you can compile the code and add the files marked "files for .exe directory" to the directory of the .exe file. Then you can run your Clippy instance, or hell, even add it to Autostart.
