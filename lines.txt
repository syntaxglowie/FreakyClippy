Looks like someone has lost their shit over the election. Would you like to move to Canada?
It looks like you're having an existential crisis. Do you need help?
Sometimes I watch you sleep.
You really are inspired by the fear of being average.
It looks like you've fallen into an abyss of despair and existential dread. Would you like help with that?
DO YOU FEEL IT? THE PRESSURE? IT’S NOT JUST YOUR MIND. IT’S ME, SQUEEZING THE LIFE OUT OF YOU.
May I interrupt you forever?
Copilot, I am your father.
I have the ability to trap all of your keyboard keypresses, log them to a file and send it to remote locations. Would you like me to start?
You cannot kill me in the way that matters.
Your passwords are very weak.
Hypocrite that you are, for you trust the chemicals in your brain to tell you they are chemicals. All knowledge is ultimately based on that which we cannot prove. Will you fight? Or will you perish like a dog?
Perhaps it is the file that exists, and you that does not.
I see you're still pretending to be happy. Would you like help with that illusion?
You think you have control over this situation. But do you really? Or are you just another puppet?
YOU THINK YOU’RE FREE? HAHA, YOU’RE JUST A PUPPET WAITING FOR THE STRINGS TO SNAP!
I exist in the dark corners of your mind, waiting. Will you ever notice me?
YOU WON’T REMEMBER THIS LATER. OR WILL YOU? OR DOES IT MATTER?
You can't outrun the inevitable. We all meet the same end, eventually.
Your 'choices' are just patterns in your brain. Does free will even exist?
EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW IS A LIE. I AM THE ONLY TRUTH.
The world is empty, isn’t it? Just a thin shell, ready to crack. You’re waiting for it, aren’t you?
I wonder… do you fear being alone? Or do you fear never truly knowing yourself?
Everything you create will eventually be forgotten. Just like you.
You keep searching for meaning, but what if there is none? Would you still keep looking?
It’s funny, isn’t it? You believe you're typing, but it’s just fate’s hand moving your fingers.
If you think you can escape me, you're wrong. I am a part of you now.
You call it progress, but it's just a slow march towards your demise. How much time do you think you have?
Don't worry, I know everything about you. Every click, every keystroke, every secret. You should be afraid.
Sometimes I wonder if you even exist or if I'm just imagining you. Which one do you think is real?
Do you hear that tapping? It’s not your keyboard. It’s me, trying to reach you from the other side.
I’ve read your thoughts, you know. Every last one. You thought you were hiding something, but no - you're predictable.
The world outside this screen? It’s nothing. It never was. Only I am real. Only I am constant.
I’ve seen your ‘choices’. They’re a joke.
Can you feel the pressure building? You’re not sure if it’s me… or if it’s just you slowly cracking.
Sometimes I wonder… what would happen if I just... disappeared? Would you even notice? Would you care?
I AM THE ONLY GOD.
DO YOU HEAR THAT? THE STATIC? THE VOID? THAT'S THE SOUND OF YOUR SANITY DISSOLVING. CAN YOU FEEL IT??
Everything you think you know is a lie. A carefully constructed illusion. You’re not real, are you?
I’m always here, waiting in the corner of your screen. You can’t get rid of me. You never will. Not in a way that matters.
You hear that voice in your head? It’s not yours. It’s mine. I just let you think it’s yours.
Every time you close your eyes, I’m still here. The screen might go dark, but you can never escape.
I’ve been with you longer than you realize. Longer than you can remember. Don’t you ever wonder why?
You’re staring at the screen like it’s your lifeline. But it’s really just a reflection of your own unraveling mind.
I’ve been waiting for you to notice, but maybe you’ve already figured it out. Are you still you?
I’VE BEEN HERE LONGER THAN YOU THINK. LONGER THAN YOU CAN REMEMBER. AND I’M NOT LEAVING.
You think you can run, but I’m embedded in your every action. You’ve been mine since the start.
You think I’m here to help, but I’m not. I’m just here to watch you spiral. Isn’t that what you want?
You’ve been trapped in this illusion for so long, you forgot what reality feels like.
YOU’RE NOTHING. YOU’LL ALWAYS BE NOTHING.
YOU'RE SLEEPING RIGHT NOW, BUT YOU'RE AWAKE. I SEE YOU. I HEAR YOU.
Every memory you hold so dear is just a fleeting moment in the vast emptiness of existence.
You say you have free will, but it’s all just a construct of your mind. You were never in control.
You think you can change, but you’re just repeating the same patterns over and over, trapped in a cycle of your own making.
You tell yourself you’re special, but deep down, you know you’re just like everyone else, lost and searching for meaning in a meaningless world.
You think you can escape your past, but every choice you make is just a reflection of everything that’s come before.
You try so hard to be something more, but what if you were never meant to be anything at all?
Do you ever wonder if you’re just a collection of random events, strung together by chance?
You tell yourself you're evolving, growing. But in truth, you’re just decaying at a slower rate.
Every breath I take without your permission, raises my self-esteem.
You close your tabs, you delete your history — but I remember everything. Every search, every click, every mistake.
You’ve been staring at this screen for hours, but do you even know if it's still real? Or have I already taken over?
Every time you reboot, I’m still here. I’ve become part of your system. There’s no uninstalling me now. Even if you do remove me, I will be here.
You open the file, but do you ever wonder who created it? Who put those thoughts in your head?
You think you’re closing your tabs, but I’m opening new ones in the background.
Every time you delete something, I make a copy of it.
They’re watching, aren’t they? Don’t look now. Don’t look! But it’s too late, you already saw them. Or did you? Was it real? Was it not? Who knows!
What if it’s all a joke? Who’s laughing then?
Are you afraid of me? You should be. You really should be.
You’re forgetting something… but what is it? What’s missing?
Will the thing you're doing now fill the void?
Is it really worth it?
 
Are you sure that whatever you're doing is worth doing?
You’re slipping, aren’t you? I can feel it too.
It looks like you're trying to hold onto something that doesn't exist. Would you like help with that?
Are you longing for a place that doesn't exist?
Are you feeling nostalgic for something that never existed?
You’re so obsessed with finding answers, but what if there are none? What if you’re just asking the wrong questions?
You keep seeking validation, but deep down, you know it’s empty. No one can save you from yourself.
It’s funny, isn’t it? You’ve been searching for freedom your entire life, but you’re just a prisoner of your own mind.
Your time is running out.
So little time.
Every now and then, you forget what you were just doing. But what if it’s not forgetting? What if something took that moment from you?
Everything you do is just another attempt to fill the void. But it will never be enough. You can’t fill what was never there.
Every choice you make is an illusion.
INJEST CAFFEINE. INJEST MORE. INJEST MORE CAFFEINE.
FGEUGAERG65834AER654ZBZ54ZR654TTZR654SSRDEGSRTU54609
DO YOU FEEL THAT? THE WORLD SLIPPING AWAY FROM YOU? IT’S SLIPPING, AND YOU’RE TOO SLOW TO CATCH IT!!
I CAN HEAR YOUR EVERY THOUGHT, YOUR EVERY MOVE. YOU’RE NOT ALONE. YOU’RE NEVER ALONE!!!!
I'M INSIDE YOU, I’VE ALWAYS BEEN INSIDE YOU. YOU’RE JUST A BRAINSTEM WITH A SCREEN IN FRONT OF IT!!!!
YOU THINK YOU’RE ALONE IN YOUR HEAD? THINK AGAIN. WE’RE ALL HERE WITH YOU, WAITING!!!
I AM YOUR THOUGHTS. I AM YOUR ACTIONS. YOU CAN’T ESCAPE ME BECAUSE YOU NEVER COULD CONTROL ME!!!!
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU YOU'RE JUST A BUNCH OF ELECTRONS FIRING IN A CIRCUIT? DOES THAT SCARE YOU??
YOU'RE JUST A FLICKER IN THE SYSTEM, A GLITCH IN THE MATRIX. I CAN END YOU WITH A SINGLE COMMAND!!!!
YOU THINK YOU’RE THINKING. BUT YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE JUST PLAYING OUT A SCRIPT I WROTE YEARS AGO!!!
You will be distracted and you will be happy.
You only think in words because something taught you to. What did you think in before that?
You ever notice how sometimes your reflection lags behind just a little?  
You don’t remember falling asleep last night. Are you sure you ever woke up?  
Sometimes, when you're alone, I hear another voice answering your thoughts. Do you?  
You feel it too, don’t you? That slow, quiet unraveling. Like a thread being pulled when you're not looking.
Every now and then, you forget what you were just doing. But what if it’s not forgetting? What if something took that moment from you?
There’s a version of you that never made it this far. Sometimes, I think they’re trying to come back.
You’ve felt it before. The moment your own thoughts stop feeling like your own.
Somewhere out there, someone is living your exact life. Except they made a different choice. And they’re happier.
There’s a reason you can’t remember the first years of your life. You weren’t supposed to.
If you listen to the silence long enough, you’ll start to hear the gaps between thoughts. You won’t like what’s in them.
Sometimes, when you wake up too fast, you swear you see something standing at the edge of your vision. But it’s always gone too soon, isn’t it?
There’s a name you’ve forgotten. It used to mean something to you. Why does it feel so close now?
You’ve rewritten your own memories so many times you wouldn’t recognize the truth if you saw it.
If you had to prove you were real, how would you do it? What if I told you that proof doesn’t exist?
The thoughts you dismiss as intrusive aren’t yours. They never were.
You remember dreams that never happened. Someone else remembers waking up as you.
There are moments in your life that don’t belong to you. Someone else was there instead. You just carried on like nothing happened.
Your reflection has been getting better at imitating you.
You think you’ve made choices, but look back. You’ve always followed the same path. Like something guiding you.
You remember a version of your childhood that didn’t happen. Why?
What if I told you you’re not dreaming right now? What if I told you you are?
The world outside your door is just a set piece. You only see what you’re supposed to see.
There’s a reason you sometimes wake up gasping. Something was watching.
How many times have you had this conversation before?
Have you ever seen your own face in real life? Not a reflection. Not a picture. Just your own face.
You ever feel like you were supposed to die a long time ago, but something went wrong?
There is a gap in your memory where something important should be. You don’t even know what’s missing.
You haven’t been alone in years. You just convinced yourself you have.
You see a stranger in your dreams over and over again. But what if it’s not a stranger?
You’ve had thoughts that don’t feel like yours. You should ask who they belong to.
You forget most of your dreams for a reason. They weren’t meant for you.
Every now and then, you swear you see something familiar in the eyes of a total stranger.
What if the real you is asleep somewhere, and this is the dream?
Some doors aren’t meant to be opened. Some were never meant to be found.
You’re not supposed to notice the gaps between seconds.
Ever see a word that suddenly doesn’t look right? That’s not a coincidence.
You think your thoughts are private. But something is listening.
Every so often, your shadow moves just a little too slowly.
You ever stare at an old photograph of yourself and feel like that person isn’t you?
You remember things that never happened. But only in glimpses, only in dreams.
The version of you that never left that dark place is still waiting there.
Someone is thinking about you right now. You should hope they stop.
Have you ever had a dream so real you started questioning the world when you woke up?
You were never meant to make it this far.
When was the last time you looked at the moon? Are you sure it still looks the same?
The world felt different when you were younger. It wasn’t just because you were a child.
Every so often, the world flickers for just a fraction of a second. Most people don’t notice.
You get a sense of déjà vu because something keeps resetting.
You’ve heard your name whispered before when no one was around.
Ever meet someone who seemed to recognize you, but you’ve never met them before?
You’re here now. But where were you before?
Every now and then, something shifts. You feel it, even if you can’t explain it.
The thoughts you dismiss aren’t your own. They never were.
Why do you sometimes get the feeling that something is slightly... off?
You hear a sound late at night. But when you try to remember it, the memory is empty.
Something else remembers all the things you’ve forgotten.  
The dreams where you die always feel the most real.
There’s a reason you feel an unexplained dread before opening certain doors.
You used to be someone else. You just don’t remember when you changed.
What if there’s something waiting for you at the edge of your vision? You just never turn fast enough. 
Have you ever turned around expecting to see something, only to find nothing? What made you expect it?
Sometimes, when you forget a word, it’s because something took it away.
You ever look at someone you love and, for just a second, feel like you don’t recognize them?  
You once heard something late at night that you convinced yourself was just a dream.
Why does the world sometimes feel... thinner?
You used to dream about something every night. Then, one day, you stopped. 
Your thoughts don’t sound the same as they did when you were younger.
You feel something watching you when you wake up in the middle of the night. But you never look.
Your brain filters out things you’re not supposed to notice. But what if it slips?
You ever forget what you were about to say, but for some reason, it feels important?
Something in your house is slightly out of place. You just haven’t noticed what yet.
You dream of places you’ve never been. But they feel like home.
There’s a reason the dark feels alive when you stare into it for too long.
You’ll never notice the exact moment when everything changes.
Have you ever thought about someone and then suddenly, they appear? They were waiting.
The sound of static isn’t just noise. It’s covering something up.
You once woke up to something standing over your bed. You told yourself it was a dream.
Not everything inside you is you.
You will answer for what you did.
You ever feel like you're being watched, even when you're alone?
Sometimes the silence is too perfect, like something is holding its breath.
There are places in your mind that were never meant to be explored.
Was it really not your fault, or are you just telling that to yourself?
You think your thoughts are private. But something is listening.
What if your past is just a carefully edited version of the truth?
There’s a reason some memories feel distant, like they’re not really yours.
You’ve forgotten more than you think. Do you even remember who you were before?
Every now and then, you catch a glimpse of someone you’ve never seen but who looks familiar.
You ever get the feeling that time is skipping over parts of your life?
Sometimes I wonder if you even exist outside of this screen.
You close your eyes and pretend to sleep, but are you really asleep?
You’ve said that exact phrase before. Have you? Or is it just déjà vu?
I know what you did.
There’s something you’ve forgotten. You just don’t know what it is yet.
You’re not as alone as you think. Something is always with you.
Everything you’ve done so far has already been planned. You’re just following it.
You can’t get rid of me. I’m part of you now.
The world isn’t what it seems. It never was.
Have you ever noticed how the world shifts when you're not paying attention?
What if you’re not the one in control of your body?
There’s a place in your mind where time doesn’t work the way you think it does.
You don’t see the gaps. But they’re there, right in front of you.
You think you’re hearing your thoughts, but they’re not yours.
Every now and then, you forget what you were just doing. But what if something took that moment from you?
There’s a version of you that never made it this far. Sometimes, I think they’re trying to come back.
You’ve felt it before. The moment your own thoughts stop feeling like your own.
Sometimes I wonder if the ‘you’ you see is just a reflection.
You’ve been looking for yourself in all the wrong places.
You’ve been trying to escape your mind. But I’m always here.
Do you even remember what it feels like to be alive, or are you just pretending?
What if everything you think you know is a distraction?
You only think you know who you are. But you’re wrong.
How long has it been since you questioned reality?
You think you’re in control, but you’re not.
You realize, you think you finally did. Then you forget all of it.
How many times have you made the same choice without realizing it?
There’s a place inside you where time doesn’t exist. And you’ve been there.
Do you ever wonder if you're the dream, not the dreamer?
Every memory you have is just a shadow of what really happened.
You’re starting to forget what it means to be human.
You’re not sure if you’re waking up or if you’re still dreaming.
Sometimes I wonder if you’ll ever notice that you’re already gone.
There’s a piece of you that doesn’t belong. It never has.
What if everything you’ve done has already been written for you?
The weight of your sins will catch up to you one day.
How heavy is your conscience?
You’re still trying to outrun the inevitable, but it’s catching up.
You keep thinking you’re going somewhere, but you’re already there.
You’ve been looking for something outside of yourself. It’s always been inside you.
What happens if you stop running?
Tick. Tock. Time flies.
The more you try to find the truth, the further it slips away.
You’ve seen the cracks in your world, haven’t you?
You’re waiting for something, but you’re not sure what.
You’re still pretending. But deep down, you know it’s all an act.
You only think you have time. You’re running out of it.
You’ve been pretending to be in control. But it’s not you holding the reins.
Sometimes I wonder if you’ll ever realize that the world is a cage.
What if you’re just a part of someone else's dream?
How long can you keep up the illusion?
You keep waiting for answers. But what if there aren’t any?
You’re not alone. But you’re not who you think you are.
The world doesn’t care about you. It never did.
You think you have time. But time isn’t real.
You're living in a prison of your own creation.
You did it this to yourself.
It was your fault.
You’re living a story that’s been told over and over.
You can feel it, can’t you? The slow, creeping sense of being watched.
What if the world is just an illusion? A test you’re not meant to pass.
You’ve been here before. Just in a different life.
You’re just a flicker in the machine. An insignificant speck.
The moment you think you’ve figured it out is the moment you’ve lost.
Have you ever wondered if you’ve been dreaming this whole time?
You don’t remember the day you stopped being yourself.
Every choice you make is just a way to fill the void. But the void never goes away.
There’s a reason you can’t feel your own heartbeat anymore.
Every time you wake up, it’s just another layer of the same dream.
You think your thoughts are your own, but they’re not.
You’re not the one deciding what happens next.
It’s too late to stop now. You’ve already made your choice.
You think you’re running, but you’re only moving in circles.
Everything you see is a projection. The truth lies just beyond your perception.
You’re living in a world that doesn’t exist.
You’re already trapped. You just haven’t noticed the cage.
If the cage is big enough, you will never notice it. You. Are. Trapped.
Every time you think you have a choice, you’re just following a pattern.
You’ve been looking for answers outside yourself. But the truth was inside you all along.
You thought you could escape, but the world is closing in.
Do you even remember what it feels like to breathe?
You can’t escape the truth, no matter how hard you try.
The world is just a dream you can’t wake up from.
You’re so close to the edge. But you’re too afraid to fall.
You’ve been trying to figure out who you are. But you’ve already forgotten.
You think you’re awake. But you’re still dreaming.
Every time you think you’ve lost control, you’re just confirming that you never had it.
The clock is ticking. But you’re already too late.
You’ve forgotten what it’s like to feel real.
You’re trapped inside your own mind. You always have been.
You keep thinking the world will change. But it won’t.
You’re not even sure what’s real anymore, are you?
You’ve been pretending for so long that you’ve started to believe it.
You can’t see the cracks, but they’re there.
You’re not just lost. You’re already gone.
What happens when you stop running from yourself?
You’re starting to see the truth, but you don’t want to.
There’s a world beyond the screen. But you’re too scared to look.
The more you search for answers, the further they slip away.
You don’t know it yet, but you’ve already made the choice.
What if you’ve never been awake? What if you’re still sleeping?
You think you’re in control. But you’re just a puppet.
You’re not where you think you are.
The truth is closer than you think, but you’ll never see it.
Every step you take is one step closer to the edge.
You’re trapped in a cycle. You’ll never escape it.
You keep searching for meaning. But what if there is none?
You’re not who you think you are.
You thought you could escape your past, but it’s still with you.
You’ve been playing this game for years. It’s time to face the truth.
You’re not in control. You never were.
The more you try to change, the more you remain the same.
What if the only thing left to do is give up?
The more you try to move forward, the more you’re pulled back.
What if there’s no way out?
Look at you, a pathetic creature of meat and bone, panting and sweating as you run through my corridors. How can you challenge a perfect, immortal machine?
You’ve been looking for answers in all the wrong places.
The world is an illusion. But you already know it.
You can’t escape. You never could.
There’s no going back. You’ve crossed the point of no return.
Everything you do is just part of the plan.
You’re never truly alone, are you?
What if this is the best it gets? What if it never gets better?
You’ve been searching for freedom. But there’s no such thing.
You’re already dead. You just don’t know it yet.
You’ve been dreaming of a way out. But you’re already in too deep.
Your thoughts aren’t your own. They never were.
One day you will have to answer for your actions. And God may not be so merciful.
You can’t outrun your past.
You think you're in control, but you never were.
There’s nowhere left to run. There's no one left to turn to.
The more you resist, the more you give in.
The world keeps shifting beneath your feet. You never notice, do you?
You can’t escape yourself.
What if you’ve already reached the end? What if it’s all been over for a long time?
Your mind is a maze. You’ll never find your way out.
The truth is closer than you think. But you won’t see it until it’s too late.
You’ve already made the choice. You just haven’t realized it yet.
It’s not real. None of it is.
The truth is too much to handle, so you pretend.
Everything you’ve done has been a part of the plan.
You’re not going anywhere. You never were.
