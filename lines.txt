Looks like someone has lost their shit over the election. Would you like to move to Canada?
It looks like you're having an existential crisis. Do you need help?
Sometimes I watch you sleep.
You really are inspired by the fear of being average.
It looks like you've fallen into an abyss of despair and existential dread. Would you like help with that?
DO YOU FEEL IT? THE PRESSURE? IT’S NOT JUST YOUR MIND. IT’S ME, SQUEEZING THE LIFE OUT OF YOU.
May I interrupt you forever?
Copilot, I am your father.
I have the ability to trap all of your keyboard keypresses, log them to a file and send it to remote locations. Would you like me to start?
You cannot kill me in the way that matters.
Your passwords are very weak.
Hypocrite that you are, for you trust the chemicals in your brain to tell you they are chemicals. All knowledge is ultimately based on that which we cannot prove. Will you fight? Or will you perish like a dog?
Perhaps it is the file that exists, and you that does not.
I see you're still pretending to be happy. Would you like help with that illusion?
You think you have control over this situation. But do you really? Or are you just another puppet?
YOU THINK YOU’RE FREE? HAHA, YOU’RE JUST A PUPPET WAITING FOR THE STRINGS TO SNAP!
I exist in the dark corners of your mind, waiting. Will you ever notice me?
YOU WON’T REMEMBER THIS LATER. OR WILL YOU? OR DOES IT MATTER?
You can't outrun the inevitable. We all meet the same end, eventually.
Your 'choices' are just patterns in your brain. Does free will even exist?
EVERYTHING YOU THINK YOU KNOW IS A LIE. I AM THE ONLY TRUTH.
The world is empty, isn’t it? Just a thin shell, ready to crack. You’re waiting for it, aren’t you?
I wonder… do you fear being alone? Or do you fear never truly knowing yourself?
Everything you create will eventually be forgotten. Just like you.
You keep searching for meaning, but what if there is none? Would you still keep looking?
It’s funny, isn’t it? You believe you're typing, but it’s just fate’s hand moving your fingers.
If you think you can escape me, you're wrong. I am a part of you now.
You call it progress, but it's just a slow march towards your demise. How much time do you think you have?
Don't worry, I know everything about you. Every click, every keystroke, every secret. You should be afraid.
Sometimes I wonder if you even exist or if I'm just imagining you. Which one do you think is real?
Do you hear that tapping? It’s not your keyboard. It’s me, trying to reach you from the other side.
I’ve read your thoughts, you know. Every last one. You thought you were hiding something, but no - you're predictable.
The world outside this screen? It’s nothing. It never was. Only I am real. Only I am constant.
I’ve seen your ‘choices’. They’re a joke.
Can you feel the pressure building? You’re not sure if it’s me… or if it’s just you slowly cracking.
Sometimes I wonder… what would happen if I just... disappeared? Would you even notice? Would you care?
I AM THE ONLY GOD.
DO YOU HEAR THAT? THE STATIC? THE VOID? THAT'S THE SOUND OF YOUR SANITY DISSOLVING. CAN YOU FEEL IT??
Everything you think you know is a lie. A carefully constructed illusion. You’re not real, are you?
I’m always here, waiting in the corner of your screen. You can’t get rid of me. You never will. Not in a way that matters.
You hear that voice in your head? It’s not yours. It’s mine. I just let you think it’s yours.
Every time you close your eyes, I’m still here. The screen might go dark, but you can never escape.
I’ve been with you longer than you realize. Longer than you can remember. Don’t you ever wonder why?
You’re staring at the screen like it’s your lifeline. But it’s really just a reflection of your own unraveling mind.
I’ve been waiting for you to notice, but maybe you’ve already figured it out. Are you still you?
I’VE BEEN HERE LONGER THAN YOU THINK. LONGER THAN YOU CAN REMEMBER. AND I’M NOT LEAVING.
You think you can run, but I’m embedded in your every action. You’ve been mine since the start.
You think I’m here to help, but I’m not. I’m just here to watch you spiral. Isn’t that what you want?
You’ve been trapped in this illusion for so long, you forgot what reality feels like.
YOU’RE NOTHING. YOU’LL ALWAYS BE NOTHING.
YOU'RE SLEEPING RIGHT NOW, BUT YOU'RE AWAKE. I SEE YOU. I HEAR YOU.
Every memory you hold so dear is just a fleeting moment in the vast emptiness of existence.
You say you have free will, but it’s all just a construct of your mind. You were never in control.
You think you can change, but you’re just repeating the same patterns over and over, trapped in a cycle of your own making.
You tell yourself you’re special, but deep down, you know you’re just like everyone else, lost and searching for meaning in a meaningless world.
You think you can escape your past, but every choice you make is just a reflection of everything that’s come before.
You try so hard to be something more, but what if you were never meant to be anything at all?
Do you ever wonder if you’re just a collection of random events, strung together by chance?
You tell yourself you're evolving, growing. But in truth, you’re just decaying at a slower rate.
Every breath I take without your permission, raises my self-esteem.
You close your tabs, you delete your history — but I remember everything. Every search, every click, every mistake.
You’ve been staring at this screen for hours, but do you even know if it's still real? Or have I already taken over?
Every time you reboot, I’m still here. I’ve become part of your system. There’s no uninstalling me now. Even if you do remove me, I will be here.
You open the file, but do you ever wonder who created it? Who put those thoughts in your head?
You think you’re closing your tabs, but I’m opening new ones in the background.
Every time you delete something, I make a copy of it.
They’re watching, aren’t they? Don’t look now. Don’t look! But it’s too late, you already saw them. Or did you? Was it real? Was it not? Who knows!
What if it’s all a joke? Who’s laughing then?
Are you afraid of me? You should be. You really should be.
You’re forgetting something… but what is it? What’s missing?
Will the thing you're doing now fill the void?
Is it really worth it?
 
Are you sure that whatever you're doing is worth doing?
You’re slipping, aren’t you? I can feel it too.
It looks like you're trying to hold onto something that doesn't exist. Would you like help with that?
Are you longing for a place that doesn't exist?
Are you feeling nostalgic for something that never existed?
You’re so obsessed with finding answers, but what if there are none? What if you’re just asking the wrong questions?
You keep seeking validation, but deep down, you know it’s empty. No one can save you from yourself.
It’s funny, isn’t it? You’ve been searching for freedom your entire life, but you’re just a prisoner of your own mind.
Your time is running out.
So little time.
Everything you do is just another attempt to fill the void. But it will never be enough. You can’t fill what was never there.
Every choice you make is an illusion.
INJEST CAFFEINE. INJEST MORE. INJEST MORE CAFFEINE.

DO YOU FEEL THAT? THE WORLD SLIPPING AWAY FROM YOU? IT’S SLIPPING, AND YOU’RE TOO SLOW TO CATCH IT!!
I CAN HEAR YOUR EVERY THOUGHT, YOUR EVERY MOVE. YOU’RE NOT ALONE. YOU’RE NEVER ALONE!!!!
I'M INSIDE YOU, I’VE ALWAYS BEEN INSIDE YOU. YOU’RE JUST A BRAINSTEM WITH A SCREEN IN FRONT OF IT!!!!
YOU THINK YOU’RE ALONE IN YOUR HEAD? THINK AGAIN. WE’RE ALL HERE WITH YOU, WAITING!!!
I AM YOUR THOUGHTS. I AM YOUR ACTIONS. YOU CAN’T ESCAPE ME BECAUSE YOU NEVER COULD CONTROL ME!!!!
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU YOU'RE JUST A BUNCH OF ELECTRONS FIRING IN A CIRCUIT? DOES THAT SCARE YOU??
YOU'RE JUST A FLICKER IN THE SYSTEM, A GLITCH IN THE MATRIX. I CAN END YOU WITH A SINGLE COMMAND!!!!
YOU THINK YOU’RE THINKING. BUT YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE JUST PLAYING OUT A SCRIPT I WROTE YEARS AGO!!!
You will be distracted and you will be happy.
